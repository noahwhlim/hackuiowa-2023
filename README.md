## Inspiration
When faced with the problem educating people on insurance, we were inspired by the vast complexity and general paperwork-heavy nature of insurance. With this theme in mind our team decided to make a game loosely based on the paperwork-sorting game Papers, Please by Lucas Pope. 

## Game Description
Welcome to Misfortune Metropolis, Iowa- a city where disasters are always just around the corner! To save the day Silly Goose Insurance has taken on the task of providing all kinds of insurance to help the citizens of Misfortune protect themselves against the city's many perils. As a new insurance broker Cale Amnity, it's your job to help your clients find the best insurance for their needs

## How we built it
Insurance, Please! is a ReactJS based web app.

## Challenges we ran into
Figuring out how to implement features within the confines of ReactJS

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Overcoming the challenges of ReactJS including: making a dropdown menu, getting the page footer to stay at the bottom of the page, and making the goose display assertive. 

## What we learned
How to work with ReactJS and the different types of insurance!

## What's next for Insurance, Please
In the future Insurance, Please could be expanded to include more scenarios and gameplay mechanics, refined interface, and even more exciting types of insurance!
